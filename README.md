## aoPlotlyAddOn.newTimeseriesPlot

### Description


This functions adds functionality, and applies to time series plots. It adds:

* **Frequency resampling** (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) and various **aggregations** (close, average, change, %change, etc.). 
* **Log/linear** yaxis button
* **Real/Nominal** button
* **Compare/Uncompare** button, a button to compare series to a base value at the beggining of the range
* **Trim** the series to be read from an initial date.
* It includes the display of **xaxis ticks** for a specific time range, naming quarters of half-years as the case may be.

### Arguments (divInfo, series, settings, timeInfo, layout, options)

**divInfo** (object) Contains the following properties:
>
> **wholeDivID** (string) "your whole div id".  Whole div name, where you will have your plot, including other html items, like your titles and footnotes. required to hide div while plot loads.

<br>
**series** (array of objects) One object for each trace or trace section. Each object contains information about traces, where data is located and to be read from. Each object is structured as follows:
>

>
> **endOfWeek:** (integer between 0 and 6) Sets the end of week. Applies to calculation of weekly values and display of weeks. 0 Sunday, 1 Monday, etc.
>
> **changeFrequencyAggregationTo:** (object) Optional. In case an initial change of frequency and aggregation is desired.
>>
>> **frequency:** (string) Optional. Any of 'daily', 'weekly'....
>>
>> **aggregation:** (string) Optional. Any of 'close', 'average', 'change', 'percChange', 'sqrPercChange', cumulative'
>
> **displayRecessions:** (boolean) Optional. Set to true to displays background area for recession periods.
>
> **allowRealNominal:** (boolean) Optional. Set to true to displays button for convertion between real an nominal.
>
> **initialRealNominal:** (string) Optional. Set to "real" or "nominal". Sets the initial display of traces to which real transformation is applicable)

## aoPlotlyAddOn.getTicktextAndTickvals


This functions returns and object with the the tickvals and ticktext arrays for a specific time range, division width and margins, font type and size and a ratio for the space between ticks (specifically the ratio between (tick text + space between text) lenght to tick text length.


### Arguments:

 
**from:** (date strings as 'yyyy-mm-dd')

**to:** (date strings as 'yyyy-mm-dd')

**textAndSpaceToTextRatio:** (number) Ratio between (tick text + space between text) lenght to tick text length.

**targetFrequency:** (string) Any of 'daily', 'everyOtherDay', 'weekly', 'biweekly', 'monthly', 'quarterly', 'semiannual', 'annual', 'biennial', 'quinquennial', 'decennial', 'quadranscentennial', 'semicentennial', 'centennial', 'bicentennial', 'sestercentennial', 'quincentenary', 'milennial'

The returned ticktext and tickvals would be the best minimum fit, upwards from the targetFrequency, e.g., if 'monthly' is passed, it would return whichever fit best from monthly, quarterly, semiannual, annual and onwards

**fontFamily:** (string) Font family name.

**fontSize:** (number) Font size. 

**divWidth:** (number) Width in pixels of the current division, can be read as jQuery('name of division').width()

**leftMargin:** (number) Margins from plot to division in pixels. If layout.margin.l/r are defined, read from there, otherwise use 80 (plotly's default)

**rightMargin:** (number) Margins from plot to division in pixels. If layout.margin.l/r are defined, read from there, otherwise use 80 (plotly's default)



## aoPlotlyAddOn.transformSeriesByFrequencies


This function will populate the data object with an originalData.x, y and objects for different frequencies and methods of aggregation. This data can be used to change the frequency of displayed data.


### Arguments:


**data:** (array of data objects [{x[], y[]}, ....]) With x as date strings 'yyyy-mm-dd' and y as values.

**periodKeys:** (object) An object with the frequencies to be calculated, set to true or false. { day: true/false, week: true/false, month: true/false, quarter: true/false, semester: true/false, year: true }

**endOfWeek:** (number between 0 and 6) Day of week to be end of week period. 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, ....
